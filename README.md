# GoogleEventCompiler
This application utilizes the Python programming language, Google API, and Tkinter library for the interface. I created this application to gain experience in Python as well as implementing APIs in an application. 

_This Application is still a work in progress, and images below are prototypes!_

When started, the application will show the following interface:

This interface allows a user to select how they want the program to search for events. Option 1 is to search for all events until a particular date. Option 2 is to search for a particular amount of events in each calendar subscribed to. Option 3 allows a user to search for a number of days in the future and search for events in that range. 

Once an option has been selected and input provided, the following screen will be shown to allow the program to access your Google Calendar Account:

Finally, once given permission and allowed access to the calendar account, the following results screen will be shown:
